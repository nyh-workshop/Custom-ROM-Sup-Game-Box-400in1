## Alright, what is a "Sup *Game Box* 400-in-1"?

Here it is:

It is a Famiclone handheld with the big "Sup" that are being sold in many local online stores.

They are loaded with about 400 bootleg Famicom games and also ROM hacks.

Also, they do appear in some different colors - red, blue, black, white and yellow.

I do not know when this thing *actually* exist, I have been seeing a lot of these since late 2019 onwards.

More information on how to dump its ROM, analysis and references are on the header. :arrow_up:

##### Running a small compilation of homebrews. Fitted with the original plastic casing. A part of the plastic has been broken and filed off near the unit's power switch to accomodate the IDC cables.
